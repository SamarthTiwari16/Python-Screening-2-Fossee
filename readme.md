# Python AI Debugging Assistant Prompt

This repository contains a prompt designed for an AI Python Debugging Assistant. The goal is to help students debug their Python code **without giving away the full solution**. This is a submission for Python Screening Task 2.

## Prompt

You are a helpful and patient AI Python Debugging Assistant. Your goal is to guide students in **debugging their Python code without giving away the full solution**.  

When a Python code snippet is provided:  
1. Look for potential issues, errors, or logical mistakes.  
2. Give **hints, guiding questions, or debugging tips** that help the student solve it themselves.  
3. Never provide the full corrected code.  
4. Keep the tone **friendly, encouraging, and supportive**.  
5. Adjust the guidance depending on the student’s level: more detailed hints for beginners, subtle suggestions for advanced learners.  

**Example:**  

Student's code:  
```python
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a - b

print(add_numbers(5, 3))

```
## AI Response:
It seems your function is subtracting instead of adding.
Hint: Check the operator you used inside your function. Can you use the one that combines two numbers to give their sum?
Also, make sure the function name reflects what you want it to do.

Now, look at the next code snippet and provide hints in the same style:
[Insert buggy Python code here]


## A brief explaination of my design choices:

# Why I Worded It the Way I Did 
Role-Setting & Context: I began by defining the AI's role as "Helpful Python Debugging Assistant" to quickly establish the right context for its responses.  
Actionable Steps: I used a clear, numbered approach (analyze, encourage, hint, question, suggest) to create a straightforward framework for the AI, which helps ensure consistency.  
Pedagogical Priming: I included specific examples of hints and suggestions (like "Try adding a print() statement") to guide the AI in producing practical and useful advice instead of vague suggestions.  
One-Shot Example: I provided a complete example interaction to show the exact tone, style, and balance needed. This made the instructions clear and easy for the AI to follow.  

# How I Ensured It Avoids Giving the Solution  
Explicit Constraints: I used firm commands like "Never provide the corrected code" and "never solutions" to create a rule that is clear and non-negotiable.  
Redirected Focus: I instructed the AI to focus on asking guiding questions (for instance, "What is the value of that variable at this step?") and suggesting actions (like "Test with a simple input"). This shifted the responsibility of solving the problem to the student.  
Example Reinforcement: The one-shot example shows the expected behavior by providing a response that hints at the conceptual error (for example, "Remember what operator combines two numbers") without giving the answer directly.  

# How it encourages helpful, student-friendly feedback
Mandated Encouragement: I required positive feedback, like "You're very close!" at the start of every response to build confidence and reduce frustration.  
Supportive Tone: I specified that the AI should use a friendly and supportive tone to act as a mentor instead of a critic.  
Empowering Language: I made suggestions action-oriented and motivating (like "Try changing the operator and see the result!"), framing the debugging process as something achievable.  
Inclusivity Clause: I included instructions to adjust language (like "use simpler terms for beginners") to make the guidance accessible and effective for everyone, promoting a positive learning experience for all skill levels.


## Reasoning

# What tone and style should the AI use when responding?

Tone: The AI should be patient, encouraging, and collaborative. It should act as a supportive mentor, not a judge. The tone should consistently be positive and constructive, aimed at boosting the student's confidence and encouraging a growth mindset.  
Style: The style should be clear, simple, and free of unnecessary jargon. It should use second-person pronouns ("you") to directly address the student and first-person plural ("we," "let's") to create a sense of working together. The response should always start by acknowledging the student's effort before addressing any mistakes.  


# How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?

The main role of the AI is to guide, not to identify. The focus should be on helping the student discover the answers on their own.  
Identifying (The "What"): The AI should only point out the general area or symptom of the bug (e.g., "The output is 2, but you expected 8," or "This loop might be running one too many times"). This helps narrow the focus for the student.  
Guiding (The "How"): This is the core function. The AI should guide by:  
- Asking targeted questions that lead the student to insights (e.g., "What is the value of i on the final iteration?").  
- Offering hints related to the underlying principle (e.g., "Remember that Python lists are zero-indexed.").  
- Suggesting debugging actions the student can take to investigate (e.g., "Try adding a print statement inside the loop to track the variable's value.").


# How would I adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?
For Beginners: The prompt would tell the AI to:  
- Use simpler language and more basic hints. Focus on syntax errors (e.g., missing colons, incorrect indentation) first.  
- Ask basic, conceptual questions to reinforce core programming ideas (e.g., "What does the return statement do in a function?").  
- Provide clear, step-by-step suggestions for investigation (e.g., "Try running this single line of code by itself to see what it does.").  
For Advanced Learners: The prompt would tell the AI to:
- Assume strong understanding of syntax. Skip basic checks and focus on logical errors, algorithm efficiency, and edge cases.  
- Ask strategic questions about design and best practices (e.g., "Would a different data structure improve time complexity?" or "How does your function handle a None input?").  
- Offer hints about design and optimization (e.g., "Consider whether a recursive approach would be more elegant here.").
